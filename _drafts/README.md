# Industrial Materialism 

## :thought_balloon: Background

The goal of this project is to build an understanding of America's manufacturing stock from the angle of raw materials and in the context of exponential development of technology.

1/ Can we influence new products from the sourcing of raw materials?

2/ What arrangement of atoms could you do at the source to facilitate their later transformation? 

3/ What data is not being captured and who wants to buy it?

4/ Self-monitoring infrastructure?

### :earth_americas: Global Developments

#### Technological

Moore's Law. Every two years, transistor capacity doubles on ICs.

Law of accelerating returns. Rate of change in information technology systems increase exponentially.

Cross-disciplinary exchange. The mediation of technological advancements and ever-increasing new materials require new concepts and methods for the dissemination of knowledge. New advancements are multidisciplinary -- materials science, biology, chemistry -- and cross-disciplinary exchange needs to be communicated. 

#### Criticalities

By 2050, energy consumption will increase by 80% (OECD 2012). Correlates to life quality and population increase.

Materials criticality and scarcity. 5-10-15-20X the current supply of metals. Industry needs to scale. 

Securing the metals supply chain for energy-critical applications. Challenges to secure relationships, diverse experience and network in jurisdictions, technologies, geologies and processes. 

#### Alternate periods that favor form vs function
In Architecture
- New production methods have "robbed the architectural shape of its material dimension and only during manufacturing finds a reference back to the material" (Jeska)
- Insists that dynamic processes should under no means end with the completion of a building (Oosterhuis, TU Delft Professor). We'll move to buildings that become liquid, not static, and not only metaphorically in the design process. Flexible, dynamic, in form and structure
  - Change through intrinsic properties, eg. early thermostats
  - Change through over the air digital updates, eg. tesla software updates 
  - Change bodies and shape in real-time
  - Change through physical manipulation ex post production

In philosophy and economy
  - The prosperous gilded age brought romanticism, the exploration of the sublime, as the necessary compliment of a rounded life (favor the form)
  - The concomittant of the great depression was a return to the practical and frugal (favor the functional) 

#### From industrial mass production to mass customization
- Mass production made way to standardization and loss of complexity (information)
- Modernity has led to a superficiality of forms. It introduces rules that allows filtering and comparing. Evaluating comprehensible characteristics is fast and manageable method to process information. Standardization, repetition, regularity, leads to loss of information.
- Historically, there has always been a problem of productivity vs. product changes. GM shortened the gap with Ford, when they decided to introduce yearly model changes. Reliable and scalable is no longer enough, it must adapt -- with shortening periodicity -- to new market demands.

#### A lack of purpose
- Conscription to the army and the expectation of war as a meaning has been replaced by prosperity and a decreasing need to commit into long-term projects
- The adoption of atheism and the expulsion of religious traditions leaves an unfilled void  
- Technologists fill this void with aspirational advances in technology, often those that seem unsormountable, eg. AGI, Mars frontier, BCIs, transhumanism.
- Junkspace portrays a generalized type of building, which according to Koolhas appears all over the planet, uniting everything into "a seamless patchwork of the permanently disjointed". Junkspace is the entropic offspring of disoriented global activity, the fatal triumph of quantity over quality.
- There is an incompetence to use new technology to create spatial meaning and identity. Koolhas, Junkspace
- Architecture has become superficial and shallow, focuses on formal appearance rather than its larger purpose. Koolhas, Junkspace
- There has to be substance for the work to hold up.

### Huge concentration of information in digital form will flow to physical
- Cheap mass produced products towards niche designs and the work of artisans (Anderson 2012, Makers) 
- Seemlessly swap and modify design data without constraint in time and space. Increase in choice and possibility, the awareness of like-minded others, space-time availability, and reassurance of unlimited ability given all these is revolutionary.
- Information, especially human creativity, is concentrated in digital form. Programmable manufacturing will make this flow from digital to physical. 

### Demographics are a predictable variable
- 70 million boomers, in two batches, the early boomers and echo boomers, will bring a dramatic wealth transfer to millenials and below in this decade.
- Businesses will see dusk either from their disability to transfer knowledge or their disarability to liquidate their assets.
- How much productivity and wealth creation will be lost?
- Software may work as a link between generations. 
- There are two ways to influence the stock of production. You either increase the production capacity or you reduce the rate at which capacity becomes inoperable. This idea focuses on the later.
