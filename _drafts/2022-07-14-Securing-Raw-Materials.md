> The US ability to undergo an all-electric transition is currently beholden to China. Without US geopolitical leadership and the ingenuity to produce the required raw materials, an unreliable supply chain and volatile input prices will significantly curtail the pace of transition.

### An Industrialist Dream

In the 1910s, Ford Motors brought standardization and assembly lines, the two most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen. Staggering numbers of black Model Ts rolled out of Highland Park as a testament of the superior economics of single-purpose manufacturing.

The then-new expression "mass production", invited an imagery of unlimited wealth creation and the renewal of America. The plan was to implement Ford's methods within and outside of manufacturing. Some fancied it the only way survive in business -- to "Fordize or die".

Ford's next iteration was influenced by supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility of WWI. The plan for the new plant -- River Rouge -- was to embody an ethos of radical self-sufficiency. Every industrialist's dream: a vertically-integrated, cost-constrolled, continous operation that trascends the confines of a manufacturing facility. 

The "Rouge" was a conveyor belt of epic proportions that spanned from the American Great Lakes to the Amazonian River in Brazil. A historical feat of ingenuity that would cement his legacy and arguably one of the most useful assets for the US and Allies during WWII.

Tesla introduced a new possible future of transportation. The ability of a vehicle to be multi-fuel and with increased net efficiency, will play a key role in transitioning away from fossils-based transportation. 

Tesla's introduced a possible future of all-electric, desirable vehicles. Battery packs and electric motors are the new paradigm shift. 

Consumer demand for electric cars is so undeniable that every car manufacturer today has embraced -- often explicitly -- Tesla's mission. Maybe, they are facing a consumer-inflicted, 'Tesla-tize or die'.

China controls 60 to 80% of the ores and processing technology used for batteries.
