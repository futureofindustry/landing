In the 1910s, Ford Motors brought standardization and assembly lines, the two most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen. Staggering numbers of black Model Ts rolled out of Highland Park as a testament of the superior economics of single-purpose manufacturing.

The then-new expression "mass production", invited an imagery of unlimited wealth creation and the renewal of America. The plan was to implement Ford's methods within and outside of manufacturing. Some fancied it the only way survive in business -- to "Fordize or die".

Ford's next iteration was influenced by supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility of WWI. The plan for the new plant -- River Rouge -- was to embody an ethos of radical self-sufficiency. Every industrialist's dream: a vertically-integrated, cost-constrolled, continous operation that trascends the confines of a manufacturing facility. 

The "Rouge" was a conveyor belt of epic proportions that spanned from the American Great Lakes to the Amazonian River in Brazil. A historical feat of ingenuity that would cement his legacy and arguably one of the most useful assets for the US and Allies during WWII.
