In the 1910s, Ford Motors brought standardization and assembly lines, the two most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen. Staggering numbers of black Model Ts rolled out of Highland Park as a testament of the superior economics of single-purpose manufacturing.

The then-new expression "mass production" was touted as the means towards unlimited wealth creation and the renewal of America. Some even fancied it the only way survive in business -- to "Fordize or die".

Influenced by supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility of WWI, Ford's next vision was River Rouge, a project that would take self-sufficiency to the limit. 

The "Rouge" was every industrialist's dream -- a synchronized, vertically structured system that trascends the confines of a manufacturing facility. Ford's new conveyor spanned from the Great Lakes to the Amazonian River, commanding the entire physical transformation and delivery of a car.

A formidable example of human-machine symbiosis that enabled America's low-cost transportion and one of the most useful assets to win WWII.
