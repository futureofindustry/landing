In the 1910s, Ford Motors brought standardization and assembly lines, the two most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen. Staggering numbers of black Model Ts rolled out of Highland Park as a testament of the superior economics of single-purpose manufacturing.

The then-new expression "mass production" was touted as the means towards unlimited wealth creation and the renewal of America. Some fancied it the only way survive in business -- to "Fordize or die".

Influenced by supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility of WWI, Ford's next vision was River Rouge, a project that would become synonymous with radical self-sufficiency. 

The "Rouge" was every industrialist's dream: a vertically structured, tightly clocked and in motion operation that trascends the confines of a manufacturing facility. A conveyor of epic proportions that spanned from the American Great Lakes to the Amazonian River in Brazil, from mining raw materials, freight and production and delivery. 

A formidable machine to jumpstart affordable transport in the America and one of the most useful assets to for the US and allies to win WWII.
