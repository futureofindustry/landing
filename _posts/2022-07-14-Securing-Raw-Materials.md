> The US ability to undergo an all-electric transition - as it stands today - is beholden to China. Without US geopolitical leadership and ingenuity to produce the required raw materials, we are heading towards volatile input prices which could meaningfully curtail the pace of transition.

#### Raw Materials In, Cars Out 

In the 1920s, Ford Motors brought standardization and assembly lines, the two most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen. Staggering numbers of black Model Ts rolled out of Highland Park as a testament of the superior economics of single-purpose manufacturing.

The then-new expression "mass production", invited imagery of unlimited wealth creation and the renewal of America. The plan was to implement Ford's methods across all industries, in and outside of manufacturing. In fact, some fancied it the only way survive in business -- "Fordize or die".

Ford's relentless pursuit to cut costs led to controlling the entire supply chain: mining, transport, manufacturing, and delivery to consumer.  

#### A new paradigm

Tesla's introduced a possible future of all-electric, desirable vehicles. 
Battery packs and electric motors are the new paradigm shift. 

Electric cars, being multi-fuel and an increased net efficiency, will play a key role in transitioning away from fossils-based transportation. 

Consumer demand for electric cars is so undeniable that every car manufacturer today has embraced -- often explicitly -- Tesla's mission. Maybe, they are facing a consumer-inflicted, 'Tesla-tize or die'.

#### Raw materials in, cars out ... right? 

China controls 60 to 80% of the ores and processing technology used for batteries.
