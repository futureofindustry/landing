In the 1910s, Ford Motors brought standardization and assembly lines, the two most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen. The then-new expression "mass production" was touted as a techonlogy for unlimited wealth creation. American's saw the possibility of renewal in the staggering numbers of black Model Ts rolling out of Highland Park. 

Influenced by supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility during WWI, Ford set to take mass production and self-sufficiency to the limit.

The "Rouge" plant became every industrialist's dream ever since -- a synchronized, vertically structured system that trascends the confines of a manufacturing facility. His new conveyor spanned from the Great Lakes to the Amazonian River, commanding the entire physical transformation and delivery of a car.

A formidable example of human-machine symbiosis enabling low-cost transportion and proving to be one of the most useful assets to win WWII.
