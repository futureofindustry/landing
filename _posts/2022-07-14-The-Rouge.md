In the 1910s, Ford pioneered the most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen, standardization and assembly lines. The staggering numbers of Model Ts rolling out of Highland Park symbolized the renewal of America through industrialization. 

Soon after and influenced by supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility during WWI, Ford defined the new frontier again. This was "The Rouge", a plant that took mass production to the limit and beyond the confines of the manufacturing facility. A maximally self-sufficient, in tempo operation that spanned from the Great Lakes to the Amazonian River, commanding every stage of physical transformation between raw materials and the delivery of cars.

The Rouge industrial complex provided Americans with low-cost transportation and became one of the most useful assets to win WWII. A formidable example of human-machine systems that changed the course of history.
