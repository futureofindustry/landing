In the 1910s, Ford pioneered the most productive technologies the world has ever seen -- assembly lines and standardization. The staggering number of Model Ts rolling out of Highland Park symbolized the renewal of America through industrialization. 

During WWI, supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility influenced Ford's next vision.
This was "The Rouge", a plant that took mass production to the limit and went beyond the confines of the manufacturing facility. A self-sufficient, synchronized operation that spanned from the Great Lakes to the Amazon and commanded every stage of physical transformation between raw materials and the delivery of cars.

The Rouge industrial complex provided Americans with low-cost transportation and was one of the most useful assets to win WWII. A formidable example of human-machine systems that changed the course of history.
