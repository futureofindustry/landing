> "History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes." -- Mark Twain

In the 1910s, Ford pioneered the most productive technologies the world has ever seen -- assembly lines and standardization. The staggering number of Model Ts rolling out of Highland Park symbolized the renewal of America through industrialization. 

During WWI, supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility influenced Ford's next vision. This was "The Rouge", a plant that took mass production to the limit and went beyond the confines of the manufacturing facility. A self-sufficient operation that extended from the Great Lakes to the Amazon, and commanded every stage of physical transformation between raw materials and the delivery of cars.

While Ford unlocked low-cost transportation, a century later Tesla's mission is to accelerate the transition to sustainable energy. It's not the end that rhymes, it's the means.
