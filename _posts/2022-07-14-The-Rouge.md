In the 1910s, Ford pioneered the most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen, standardization and assembly lines. The staggering numbers of Model Ts rolling out of Highland Park symbolized the renewal of America through industrialization. 

Soon after and influenced by supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility during WWI, Ford set out to push the envolope once again. 

His new plant, "The Rouge", took mass production to the limit and became every industrialist dream -- a self-sufficient, in tempo operation that transcends the confines of a manufacturing facility. This new conveyor spanned from the Great Lakes to the Amazonian River, commanding every stage of physical transformation towards the delivery of cars.

The Rouge industrial complex enabled low-cost transportation and became one of the most useful assets to win WWII. A formidable example of human-machine systems that change the course of history.
