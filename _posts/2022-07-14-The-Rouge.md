In the 1910s, Ford pioneered the most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen, standardization and assembly lines. The staggering numbers of Model Ts rolling out of Highland Park symbolized the renewal of America through industrialization. 

Soon after and influenced by supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility during WWI, Ford envisioned the next frontier. This was "The Rouge", a plant that took mass production to the limit and went beyond the confines of the manufacturing facility. A self-sufficient, synchronized operation spanning from the Great Lakes to the Amazon, commanding every stage of physical transformation between raw materials and the delivery of cars.

The Rouge industrial complex provided Americans with low-cost transportation and was one of the most useful assets to win WWII. A formidable example of human-machine systems that changed the course of history.
