In the 1910s, Ford Motors brought standardization and assembly lines, the two most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen. The staggering numbers of Model Ts rolling out of Highland Park symbolized the renewal of America through industrialization. 

Influenced by supply chain disruption and commodity price volatility during WWI, Ford set out to push the envolope once again. "The Rouge" took mass production to the limit into every industrialist dream -- a self-sufficient, tightly clocked and perpetually in motion operation that trascends the confines of a manufacturing facility. His new conveyor spanned from the Great Lakes to the Amazonian River, commanding the entire physical transformation and delivery of a car.

This facility enabled low-cost transportion and became one of the most useful assets to win WWII. 
A formidable example of human-machine systems that change the course of history.
