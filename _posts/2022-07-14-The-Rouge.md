In the 1910s, Ford Motors brought standardization and assembly lines, the two most prolific productive technologies the world has ever seen. The staggering numbers of Model Ts rolling out of Highland Park symbolized the renewal of America through industrialization. 

A few years later, influenced by supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility during WWI, Ford set to take -- the then new expression -- "mass production" to its limits at River Rouge. 

"The Rouge" was every industrialist dream -- a self-sufficient, tightly clocked and perpetually in motion operation that trascends the confines of a manufacturing facility. This new conveyor spanned from the Great Lakes to the Amazonian River, commanding the entire physical transformation and delivery of a car.

A formidable example of human-machine systems that enabled low-cost transportion and became one of the most useful assets to win WWII.
