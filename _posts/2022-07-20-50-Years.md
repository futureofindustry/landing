> Assume climate change isn't a risk for civilization, we still only have about ~50 years to transition from fossil fuels as primary input for the world's economy. 

#### A limited resource 

Consider civilization to be a closed system with energy as its primary feedstock. 

Currently, fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) are the dominant source and by consensus will become [scarce within the next ~50 years.](https://mahb.stanford.edu/library-item/fossil-fuels-run/)

Fossil fuels are a primary input for transport, electricity, industry chemicals and agriculture. 

Successfuly transititioning to another source is one of civilization's acid tests.

#### All-Electric 

Electricity is an interesting category because it's multi-fuel and can be used as an alternative to the other fossil fuel based applications. For instance, electricity is used as precursor for fertilizers and transportation.

The dramatic reduction in levelized cost of [renewables-based electricity has made these competitive](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf) against the top incumbent -- natural gas fired plants. This is already huge progress but the limiting factor is their inherent intermitency. 

Since batteries solve the intermittency problem, the rate of sustainble energy deployment is limited by the price of renewables generation + storage.
