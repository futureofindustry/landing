> We have ~50 years to transition away from fossil fuels to sustain the world's economy.

#### A limited resource 

Civilization is a system with energy as its primary feedstock. 

Currently, fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) are the dominant source and by consensus will [run out in ~50 years.](https://mahb.stanford.edu/library-item/fossil-fuels-run/)

Fossil fuels are a primary input for transport, electricity, industry chemicals and agriculture. The underlying infrastructure for quality of life.

Successfuly transititioning to another source is one of civilization's acid tests.

#### All-Electric 

The [LCOE](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/pdf/electricity_generation.pdf) of solar and wind has dramatically reduced given the investments of many countries and economies of scale. 

However, this only considers the supply side of the plant and not paired to the demand for electricity. In other words, it doesn't factor the inherent intermittency of renewable resources.

Batteries solve the intermittency problem. Thefore, the marker that matters is LCOE of renewables + storage relative to top incumbents -- natural gas and coal fired plants.
